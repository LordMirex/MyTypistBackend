# MyTypist Backend Documentation

## Overview

MyTypist is a comprehensive document automation SaaS platform designed specifically for Nigerian businesses. It enables users to create, customize, and generate professional documents using intelligent template processing with placeholder detection and replacement. The platform supports both pay-as-you-go and subscription-based billing models, integrated with Flutterwave for seamless Nigerian payment processing.

The system is built as a high-performance, production-ready FastAPI backend that handles document generation, template management, digital signatures, user management, and payment processing with robust security measures and audit trails.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Framework Decision
The backend is built on **FastAPI** for its exceptional performance characteristics, native async support, and automatic API documentation generation. This choice enables sub-500ms document generation for up to 5 documents and maintains <50ms API response times for standard operations.

### Database Architecture
The system uses **SQLite with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode** as the primary database solution. This design decision prioritizes simplicity and performance for the MVP while maintaining a clear migration path to PostgreSQL for future scaling. WAL mode enables high concurrency by allowing readers and writers to operate simultaneously without blocking each other.

Key database optimizations include:
- Automatic WAL mode enablement with pragma settings
- Connection pooling with StaticPool for SQLite
- Foreign key constraint enforcement
- Optimized cache sizing (10,000 pages)
- 30-second busy timeout for better concurrency handling

### Caching and Task Processing
**Redis** serves dual purposes as both a caching layer and message broker for background task processing. **Celery** handles asynchronous operations including document generation, payment processing, and cleanup tasks, ensuring the main API remains responsive during heavy operations.

### Document Processing Pipeline
The document processing system uses a template-based approach with intelligent placeholder detection:
- Templates are uploaded as DOCX files with `${variable_name}` placeholders
- Real-time placeholder extraction using python-docx library
- Background document generation with Celery for scalability
- Support for complex formatting preservation and multiple file formats

### Security Architecture
Multi-layered security implementation includes:
- **JWT-based authentication** with token rotation and configurable expiration
- **Rate limiting middleware** with Redis-backed storage and category-based limits
- **Security headers middleware** for XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking protection
- **Audit logging middleware** for comprehensive activity tracking
- **Input validation** using Pydantic schemas with custom validators

### Payment Integration
**Flutterwave integration** optimized for the Nigerian market supporting:
- Local payment methods (USSD, Bank Transfer, Mobile Money)
- Webhook-based payment verification with HMAC signature validation
- Subscription management with automatic renewal and cancellation
- Balance system for pay-as-you-go users with transaction tracking

### User Management and Access Control
Role-based access control with three primary roles:
- **Standard users**: Document creation, template usage, payment management
- **Admin users**: Full system access, user management, template administration
- **Guest users**: Limited access for external signature workflows

### File Storage and Management
Organized file storage system with:
- Dedicated directories for templates, generated documents, and user uploads
- SHA256 hash-based file integrity verification
- Automatic cleanup for temporary and expired files
- Support for multiple file formats (DOCX, PDF)

### API Design Philosophy
RESTful API design with:
- Modular route organization by functional domain
- Consistent error handling and status codes
- Comprehensive request/response validation
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
- CORS configuration for frontend integration

### Performance Optimizations
- Database connection pooling and query optimization
- Background task processing for heavy operations
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimized SQLite configuration for high concurrency
- Efficient file handling with streaming responses
