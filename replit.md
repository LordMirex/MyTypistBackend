## System Architecture

### Core Framework Decision
The backend is built on **FastAPI** for its exceptional performance characteristics, native async support, and automatic API documentation generation. This choice enables sub-500ms document generation for up to 5 documents and maintains <50ms API response times for standard operations.

### Database Architecture
The system uses **SQLite with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode** as the primary database solution. This design decision prioritizes simplicity and performance for the MVP while maintaining a clear migration path to PostgreSQL for future scaling. WAL mode enables high concurrency by allowing readers and writers to operate simultaneously without blocking each other.

Key database optimizations include:
- Automatic WAL mode enablement with pragma settings
- Connection pooling with StaticPool for SQLite
- Foreign key constraint enforcement
- Optimized cache sizing (10,000 pages)
- 30-second busy timeout for better concurrency handling

### Caching and Task Processing
**Redis** serves dual purposes as both a caching layer and message broker for background task processing. **Celery** handles asynchronous operations including document generation, payment processing, and cleanup tasks, ensuring the main API remains responsive during heavy operations.

### Document Processing Pipeline
The document processing system uses a template-based approach with intelligent placeholder detection:
- Templates are uploaded as DOCX files with `${variable_name}` placeholders
- Real-time placeholder extraction using python-docx library
- Background document generation with Celery for scalability
- Support for complex formatting preservation and multiple file formats

### Security Architecture
Multi-layered security implementation includes:
- **JWT-based authentication** with token rotation and configurable expiration
- **Rate limiting middleware** with Redis-backed storage and category-based limits
- **Security headers middleware** for XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking protection
- **Audit logging middleware** for comprehensive activity tracking
- **Input validation** using Pydantic schemas with custom validators

### Payment Integration
**Flutterwave integration** optimized for the Nigerian market supporting:
- Local payment methods (USSD, Bank Transfer, Mobile Money)
- Webhook-based payment verification with HMAC signature validation
- Subscription management with automatic renewal and cancellation
- Balance system for pay-as-you-go users with transaction tracking

### User Management and Access Control
Role-based access control with three primary roles:
- **Standard users**: Document creation, template usage, payment management
- **Admin users**: Full system access, user management, template administration
- **Guest users**: Limited access for external signature workflows

### File Storage and Management
Organized file storage system with:
- Dedicated directories for templates, generated documents, and user uploads
- SHA256 hash-based file integrity verification
- Automatic cleanup for temporary and expired files
- Support for multiple file formats (DOCX, PDF)
